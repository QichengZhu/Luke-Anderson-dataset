Hi Luke,  
Thank you for agreeing in principle to pursue a proof‑of‑concept together. Our leadership team is excited to see how Amazon’s vector DB service pairs with our reranking stack. Could we schedule a 30‑minute kickoff next Monday at 10 AM Pacific? I’ll circulate an agenda once the slot is confirmed.
