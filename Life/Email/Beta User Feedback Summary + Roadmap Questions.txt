Hi Luke,  
The first cohort of beta users returned overwhelmingly positive feedback on your async API endpoints. They specifically praised the detailed error codes and retry guidance. We do have a backlog item about limiting request sizes to prevent abuse; how does your team plan to address that? I’d appreciate your insights before we finalize the Q3 roadmap.
