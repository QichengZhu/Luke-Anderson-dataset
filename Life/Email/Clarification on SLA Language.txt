Hi Luke,  
We reviewed the draft SLA and need clarity on “commercially reasonable efforts” with respect to 99.9 % uptime. Could we instead specify a numerical threshold for partial outages under one minute? Legal wants explicit remediation steps if thresholds are missed. Happy to discuss over Zoom tomorrow morning.
