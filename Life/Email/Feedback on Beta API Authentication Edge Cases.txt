Hi Luke,  
Our QA team completed another round of latency tests and the 18% gain is holding steady, which is excellent news. We did, however, uncover a token‑refresh race condition when multiple threads request new tokens simultaneously. Details are in the attached HAR capture. Could you review and advise on mitigation tactics before our next sprint planning session?
