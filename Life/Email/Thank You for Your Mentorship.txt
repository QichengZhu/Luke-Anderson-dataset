Hi Luke,  
I wanted to thank you for taking time to mentor our nonprofit’s hackathon team. Your advice on optimizing transformer inference really helped them cut GPU usage by half. We’ll showcase their project at the AI for Good Expo next month and would love to list you as an advisor. Let me know if you’re comfortable with that.
